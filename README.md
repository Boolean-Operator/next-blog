This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I have built a mock up of a blog site following the Max Schwartzmuller tutorial. The blog posts are mainly ipsum lorem and are stored as Markdown pages using react-markdown.

## Getting Started

First Download and extract a zip file or clone the repo.
Next, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Next, start your devlopment server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the application by modifying the pages.

All blog posts are stored as Markdown pages using react-markdown.

In order for the contact form to work, you will also need to set up and connect to a MongoDB project cluster.

For more information about [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be found on the NextJS docs api routes introduction.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
